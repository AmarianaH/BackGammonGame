*)Encapsulation of the game engine (or any logical layer) is important

WhiteBar,BlackBar,WhiteEnd,BlackEnd
Board.board[]  - a public array - what happens when you change the implementation of the Board class? everything will stop compiling


*)'GetBoardForPrint' is a bad choice of name - but a good practice - Print indicates that the UI is a console when in fact it can be anything


*)TryMove - good design choice - very versatile

*)Bar is not observed - changed only on initialization

*)Player - bad choice of name - game engine would be better

*) Player.WhoBegins - bug in implementation - enum is a value type and the changes made inside of the method will not be reflected outside it.

*) MoveForBlackAndWhite and WhiteAndBlackMove - what is the difference? why are both exposed?

*)Game does not work - would not accept any moves.
